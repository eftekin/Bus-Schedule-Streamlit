# Bus Schedule Streamlit

## About

Have you ever found yourself juggling between two different bus schedules, trying to catch the right one home from school every day? That was me until I decided to simplify my routine. This project emerged from my daily struggle of checking two different websites for bus schedules from Alibeyk√∂y to Bomonti.

- Scrapes bus schedule data from two websites.
- Combines and sorts the schedules for easy viewing.
- Displays the upcoming bus schedule based on the current time using Streamlit.
